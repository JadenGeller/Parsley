# Parsley

README coming soon! Check out the source code---it's pretty well documented.

Major things left to do:
- Backtracking is gross in a lot of cases. For example, I'm not satisfied with how complicated it currently is to match `many` up to some other parser.
- I've avoided using sequencing operators like the plague (I wanted this library to be more accessible to someone who knows nothing about parser combinators and all their weird operators), but the whole `dropLeft` sequencing functions are really gross. I need to decide on some reasonable compromise.
